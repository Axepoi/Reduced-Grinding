## ABOUT THIS MOD
This mod isn't supposed to make the game too easy, but makes it so you don't have to spend huge amounts of time farming for loot, for example: AFK farms to get rare item like Biome Keys.

Everything is configurable, so you can adjust to your liking. After selecting the mod, reload mods to generate the configuration file. The file is located at Documents\My Games\Terraria\ModLoader\Mod Configs and can be edited with programs like notepad or notepad++. If my mod updates with a new configuration file (with a new name, using an online text comparison tool could help if you want to keep the old configurations).

You can find out more about it on the mod page: https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/reduced-grinding.51082/

## FEEL FREE TO FORK AND EDIT
I'm not an expert in Terraria's coding language (and I find it very confusing compared to other coding languages). Any forks on Github to improve on my project is appreciated.
