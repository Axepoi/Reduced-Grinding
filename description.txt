Reduced Grinding

This mod isn't supposed to make the game too easy, but makes
it so you don't have to spend huge amounts of time farming for
loot, for example: AFK farms to get rare item like Biome Keys.
It's highly configurable, so you can adjust to your liking.
This mod info breifly explains how it this mod  works, for
more info see the link below. How this mod does this:

* New War Potion and Chaos Potion to boost spawn rates. If you
   can handle it, you'll get items faster.
* New Chlorophyte Accelerator, which allows you to turn Mud in
   to Chlorophyte Ore after defeating the Golem.
* Added New Recipes.
* Increased drop rates for many different loot items and added
   some additional drops. This is from Enemies, Grab Bags,
   Fishing, Quest Items, and Extractinator.
* New Stationary Merchant, who gains items from the Traveling
   Merchant (chance of gain items starts low when the world
   starts, but rises to 100% at hardmode). The Traveling
   Merchant will reset his items every now and then depending
   on how many town NPCs you have (he'll stop once the
   Stationary Merchant has all that he can currently get from
   him, but will continue if you carry an item that the
   Stationary Merchant sells during that time).
* Permanent stationary versions of Santa and Skeleton
   Merchant.
* Crates catches may upgrade to a better crate depending on
   the fishing power you have. They can also be upgraded and
   downgraded through crafting at a Crystal Ball at the cost
   of some items.
* Keep in mind, that the drop rate increases in configuration
   file are additional to the drops you get in vanilla (for
   example: if an item's vanilla rate = 10% and mod rate = 90%
   then the combined rate is 100% which means that it's likely
   to always drop, but if both chances fail it wont).
* New Lockboxes for different chest you'd find in the world
   and possible furniture items that would be located around
   it.
* Christmas and Halloween Spirit potions, to make it a
   holliday for a day.
* Items to instantly end the Goblin, Pirate, and Lunar
   invasion (without summoning Moonlord).
* Celestial Beacon, to make the Moon Lord summon right away.
* New Sundials to instantly skip to Night or Day (Enchanted
   Sundial cooldown and Tax Collector wont benefit from this).
* New Moon Ball to change the Moon Phase.
* New Blood Moon Medalion to summon the Blood Moon.
* Crimson/Corruption versions of Seeds/Solutions are available
   in both worlds.
